# The Dorothy Coding Challenge

![Concurso-de-Programación-canva](https://github.com/ciencialatitud0/EPIC_3/assets/30240951/e2d9fca3-4bcc-41c2-9cfc-4d817da362fd)

The Physics Without Frontiers (PWF) programme of the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), in collaboration with Grupo de Investigadores Latitud Cero, Universidad Yachay Tech, Universidad Internacional del Ecuador (UIDE), and Escuela Politécnica Nacional, has the pleasure to invite university students to participate in the **Dorothy Coding Challenge**.

The Dorothy Coding Challenge is a scientific programming contest aimed at motivating BSc students in Ecuador to pursue careers that combine computer science with natural sciences (physics, in particular). Students who participate in this year's edition will have the opportunity to team up with a peer and together demonstrate their Python coding abilities to solve tricky problems related to scientific computing.

## Requirements:

- Teams must consist of 2 students.
- All participants must:
  -  be currently registered as BSc students in any Ecuadorian university, or
  -  have gotten their BSc degrees recently (January 2022 or later).
- Teams must apply to participate by providing:
  -  a motivation letter, and
  -  a Python-language experience statement.
- Team members must be very well versed in programming with the Python language (challenges will use Python version 3.x).
 
## Application procedure and contest timeline:

Interested teams should follow these steps:

**1. Application step (deadline: 19th November 2023).**
   
   The potential participants apply for a spot by registering their team here:

   https://forms.gle/3JP5xBFJN1jAdR7FA
   
**2. Selection process (<span style="color:red">new deadline: 29th November 2023</span>).**
   
   The contest evaluation panel selects 10 teams, contacts them, and sends them three coding challenges.

**3. Dorothy Coding Challenge Contest (deadline: 10th December 2023).**
   
   The 10 selected teams send their solutions to the proposed challenges by the deadline.
   
**4. Evaluation process (deadline: 14th December 2023).**
   
   The evaluation panel submits their scores on the solutions submitted by all teams.
   
**5. Winners announcement (15th December 2023).**
   
   The winning teams are publicly announced in an online event and they receive their prizes and certificates.

## PWF prizes and certificates:

Thanks to the very generous financial support from ICTP's PWF programme, the winning teams will receive ICTP-signed certificates and the following prizes:

### Winner Team's prize: 320 USD

### Runner-up Team's prize: 160 USD

### Note: These prizes are per team, not per person.

## Topics for the programming challenges:

The 10 selected teams will have to solve three programming challenges (all in Python version 3.x) within the following areas:

1. [Zebrafish Embryo Mask Generation from Bright Field Images](https://github.com/ciencialatitud0/EPIC_3/tree/main/Dorothy_Coding_Challenge/ArtificialIntelligence_and_BioimageAnalysis)
   
2. [Fourier Analysis: removing artifacts from scientific images](https://github.com/ciencialatitud0/EPIC_3/tree/main/Dorothy_Coding_Challenge/Fourier_Analysis_Scientific_Visualisation)
   
3. [Web scraping and computer science](https://github.com/ciencialatitud0/EPIC_3/tree/main/Dorothy_Coding_Challenge/Web_Scraping_Challenge)

## Instructions for participating teams:
https://github.com/ciencialatitud0/EPIC_3/tree/main/Dorothy_Coding_Challenge


## Evaluation process and criteria:

- The selection of the 10 participating teams will be based on a blind evaluation of the motivation letters and statements of prior python programming experience. Diversity criteria will also be considered.
  
- The assessment of the winning teams will be based on the average of the scores submitted by a revision panel of experts, who will blindly review the codes and be instructed to evaluate: i) solution correctness, ii) code performance, and iii) code design and user friendliness.

## Panel of experts:

- Andrés Morales-Navarrete, Konstanz University, Germany
- Paulina Vizcaíno, UIDE, Ecuador
- Óscar Chimborazo, Universidad Yachay Tech, Ecuador
- Iván Reyes, UIDE, Ecuador
- Edison Salazar, Leiden Univeristy, The Netherlands
- Alejandro Gómez, Carnegie Mellon University, USA

## Logistics organisers:
- Helga Dénes, Universidad Yachay Tech, Ecuador
- Wladimir Banda-Barragán, Universidad Yachay Tech, Ecuador
  
## A contest to honour Dorothy Johnson Vaughan:

![dorothy_vaughan_ibm_computer](https://github.com/ciencialatitud0/EPIC_3/assets/30240951/16cbff81-dc06-4092-b811-04d5815084a6)

Dorothy Johnson Vaughan was an American mathematician and human computer who worked for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), later NASA, at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. In 1949, she became acting supervisor of the West Area Computers, the first African-American woman to receive a promotion and supervise a group of staff at the center. She later was promoted officially to the position of supervisor. During her 28-year career, Vaughan prepared for the introduction of computers in the early 1960s by teaching herself and her staff the Fortran programming language. She later headed the programming section of the Analysis and Computation Division (ACD) at Langley.
