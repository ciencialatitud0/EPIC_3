# Escuela de Programación para Investigación Científica - EPIC 3:
## "The Frontiers of Computational Physics"

Physics Without Frontiers (PWF) jointly with Grupo de Investigadores Latitud Cero, the Physics Department of Escuela Politécnica Nacional, and the School of Physical Sciences and Nanotechnology of Yachay Tech University in Ecuador are pleased to announce our upcoming summer "School of Programming for Scientific Research - EPIC 3: The Frontiers of Computational Physics".

#### Indico page: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1299902/

## General Information

The third edition of EPIC will focus on introducing computational techniques for the analysis of scientific data and images by using the programming languages python and julia as tools. Instructors will present real research problems to illustrate the use of computational tools in the experimental or theoretical study of physical systems. Basic programming notions are essential to sign up for this workshop.

The tutorials will focus on the following areas:

 * biophysics
 * astrophysics
 * materials science
 * particle physics


## Goals and deliverables:
The third edition of EPIC will focus on introducing techniques for data analysis and image processing using Python and Julia as the main tools. EPIC 3 will have plenary talks on various topics and dedicated tutorials on simulation and data analysis in physics, machine learning for physics and life sciences, observational astronomy and computational astrophysics, high-energy (particle) physics, and materials science. By the end of this school, participants will have the ability to perform basic data analysis on unprocessed raw data and images to extract important information about physical systems. Participants will also have the opportunity to present their own research work during a dedicated session.


## Venue:
The school will be held in person on the campus of Yachay Tech University from August 14th to August 18th, 2023. Yachay Tech is located in the beautiful area of Urcuquí, a place renowned for its pleasant weather conditions and its proximity to numerous tourist attractions, such as hot springs, lakes, mountains, and active and inactive volcanoes.

#### Address: Yachay Tech University, School of Physical Sciences and Nanotechnology, Hacienda San José S/N, 100119 Urcuquí, Ecuador
#### Website: https://www.yachaytech.edu.ec/en/physicsandnanotech/

**Dates**: 14th - 18th August 2023

**Format**: In person

**Duration**: 5 days

**Time investment**: 40 hours

**Cost**: there is no registration fee

## Grants:
The number of participants is limited to the 20 most motivated students. Preference will be given to students in their last semesters and who have not participated in previous editions of EPIC. Scholarships may be provided free of charge to cover accommodation or accommodation plus lunches for the most outstanding candidates throughout the duration of the school. Participants (or their universities) are expected to bear the costs of travel from their respective universities to Yachay. However, a few travel grants might be available. There is no registration fee.

## Certificate:
Students who complete the course will receive an ICTP-PWF certificate.
