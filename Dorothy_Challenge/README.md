# The Dorothy Coding Challenge

The Physics Without Frontiers (PWF) programme of the the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), in collaboration with Grupo de Investigadores Latitud Cero, Universidad Yachay Tech, Unversidad Internacional del Ecuador, and Escuela Polit√©cnica Nacional, has the pleasure to invite students to participate in the **Dorothy Coding Challenge** event.

The Dorothy Coding Challenge is a scientific programming contest aimed at motivating BSc students in Ecuador to pursue careers that combine computer science with natural sciences (physics, in particular). Students who participate in this year's edition will have the opportunity to demonstrate their Python coding abilities to solve tricky problems related to scientific computing.

## Requirements:
