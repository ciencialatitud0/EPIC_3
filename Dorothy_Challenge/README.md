# The Dorothy Coding Challenge

The Physics Without Frontiers (PWF) programme of the the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), in collaboration with Grupo de Investigadores Latitud Cero, Universidad Yachay Tech, Unversidad Internacional del Ecuador, and Escuela Politécnica Nacional, has the pleasure to invite students to participate in the **Dorothy Coding Challenge** event.

The Dorothy Coding Challenge is a scientific programming contest aimed at motivating BSc students in Ecuador to pursue careers that combine computer science with natural sciences (physics, in particular). Students who participate in this year's edition will have the opportunity to demonstrate their Python coding abilities to solve tricky problems related to scientific computing.

## Requirements:

- Teams must consist of 2 students.
- All participants must:
  -  be currently registered as BSc students in any Ecuadorian university, or
  -  have gotten their BSc degrees recently (2022 onwards).
- Teams must apply to participate by providing:
  -  a motivation letter, and
  -  a python experience statement.
- Team members must be very well versed in programming with the Python language (3.x).
 
## Application procedure and contest timeline:

Interested teams should follow these steps:

**1. Application step (deadline: 19th November 2023).**
   
   Apply for a spot by registering your team here:
   
**2. Selection process (deadline: 24th November 2023).**
   
   The organisers contact 10 selected teams.

**3. Dorothy Coding Challenge Contest (deadline: 10th December 2023).**
   
   The 10 selected teams send their solutions to the proposed challenges by the deadline.
   
**4. Evaluation process (deadline: 14th December 2023).**
   
   The evaluation panel submits their scores on the solutions submitted by all teams.
   
**5. Winners announcement (15th December 2023).**
   
   The winning teams are publicly announced in an online event and they receive their prizes and diplomas.

## PWF prizes and diplomas:

Thanks to the very generous financial support from the PWF programme, the winning teams will receive ICTP-signed diplomas and the following prizes:

### Winner Team's prize: 320 USD
### Runner-up Team's prize: 160 USD

Prizes are per team, not per person.

## Topics for the programming challenges:

The 10 selected teams will have to solve three programming challenges (all in Python) within the following areas:

1. Artificial intelligence and bioimage analysis.
   
2. Numerical modelling and scientific visualisation.
   
3. Web scraping Computer Science (Iván/Paulina)

## Evaluation process and criteria:

- The selection of the 10 participating teams will be based on a blind evaluation of the motivation letters and statements of python programming experience. Diversity criteria will also be considered.
  
- The assessment of the winning teams will be based on the average of the scores submitted by a revision panel of experts, who will blindly review the codes and be instructed to evaluate: i) solution correctness, ii) code performance, and iii) code design and user friendliness.
